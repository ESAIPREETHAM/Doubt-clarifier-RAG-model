How RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Works?
Ans:RAG combines two major approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP): retrieval-based models and generative models. It leverages the strengths of both techniques to create a system that generates responses grounded in factual information retrieved from a knowledge base.

Here's how it works step by step:

1. Input Query
The process begins when a user provides a query or question, such as:

"What is the weight of the product?"
"Explain how machine learning works?"

2. Retrieval Stage
In this phase, the system searches for the most relevant documents or passages from a large external knowledge base (such as a collection of documents, articles, or a pre-built database). The goal is to retrieve information that will serve as the foundation for generating a response.

Embedding the Query: First, the system converts the user query into a vector representation using an embedding model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). This vector captures the semantic meaning of the query.
Document Search: The vectorized query is then compared with a large set of pre-encoded documents or passages (also represented as vectors) using similarity search techniques like FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) or Elasticsearch.
Top-K Retrieval: The system selects the top-K documents or passages most relevant to the query.
Example: For a product-related query, it may retrieve several text passages that describe the productâ€™s dimensions, weight, or specifications.

3. Generation Stage
After retrieving relevant documents, the generative model (such as GPT-3 or BART) comes into play. It generates a coherent and contextually relevant response using both the original query and the retrieved information as input.

Input for the Generative Model: The model is provided with both the user query and the top-K retrieved documents. These documents act as context to guide the generation process.
Response Generation: The model uses the retrieved information to generate a detailed and factually grounded response to the query. This helps avoid the issue of "hallucinations" (i.e., generating factually incorrect or irrelevant content) common in generative-only models.
Example: If the retrieved documents mention the weight as "34 grams," the model would use this information to generate a response like, "The weight of the product is 34 grams."

4. Output Response
The final stage is producing a response that incorporates the retrieved factual information. This response is more accurate and contextually relevant than a purely generative model's output.
